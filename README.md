### 1. My Story :open_book:

I studied a Bachelor Degree in Biology at the University of Alicante but, when I tried to work as a biologist, I discovered that that was not my path. I have worked as a private teacher, NGO partner recruiter, helper in a museum and intern in an agricultural investigation station.

Some months later, I studied in Adalab. There, I discovered my true dream job, as a Developer. I have been working doing the layouts -Sass, jQuery functionalities- for shops running in PrestaShop and I am currently searching for new opportunities.

### 2. Current Technologies :woman_technologist:

I can work with Vanilla **JavaScript ES6**, **ReactJS** - and **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **Sass**. I have learn basic uses of **Gulp**, **NodeJS**, **Express** and **SQL**. Moreover, I am used to use **Git**.

### 3. Soft Skills :speaking_head:

I have been studying with the **Agile Philosophy** and the **Scrum FrameWork**. I can **communicate assertively** with people, because of my face-to-face job experience. Moreover, I am a very **organised** person.

### 4. Languages :earth_africa:

I am an Spanish native speaker, but I can speak English (level B2) and Valencian/Catalan (level B1) too.

### 5. Next Steps :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I wish to get a job where I can keep developing my skills as a programmer. I am currently studying DAM (Multiplatform Applications Development) in Alicante, and I will end these courses on 2026.
