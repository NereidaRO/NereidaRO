1. My Story

I studied a Bachelor Degree in Biology at the University of Alicante but, when I tried to work as a biologist, I discovered that that was not my career. I have work as a private teacher, ONG partner recruiter, helper in a museum and intern in an agricultural investigation station.

Some months later, I studied in Adalab. There, I discovered my true dream job, as a Developer.

2. Current Technologies

I can work with Vanilla **JavaScript ES6**, **ReactJS** - and **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Sass** and **Gulp**. I have learn basic uses of **NodeJS**, **Express** and **SQL**. Moreover, I am used to **Git** and I have an account in **Slack**.

3. Soft Skills

I have been studying with the **Agile Philosophy** and the **Scrum FrameWork**. I can **communicate assertively** with people, because of my face-to-face job experience. Moreover, I am a very **organised** person.

4. Next Steps

I wish to get a job where I can be useful and I can keep developing my skills. I also want to improve my skills of NodeJS, Express and SQL.
